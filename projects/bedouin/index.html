<b>WiFi.Bedouin</b> is an art-technology project. The initial concept and some of the software for it
    was developed during my <a
    href="http://www.eyebeam.org/engage/exhibitions/betalaunch/beta_bleecker.html">R+D
    Residency at Eyebeam Atelier</a> in NYC during the Fall and Winter
    of 2003. The project is also supported through a <a href="href="http://www.iml.annenberg.edu/vectors/projects.html">Vectors Fellowship</a> at the <a href="http://www.iml.annenberg.edu">Institute for Media Literacy</a>, which is part of the <a href="http://www.annenberg.edu">USC Annenberg Center for Communications</a>. The documentation on this site is for its submission to
    various conferences. It's real, works and uses <a
    href="../a_s_a_p/index.html">this</a> .NETcf app I wrote for the PDA/GPS. 
    <p/>WiFi.Bedouin is a wearable, mobile 802.11b node disconnected from the global Internet. It forms a WiFi <b><i>&quot;island Internet&quot;</i></b> challenging conventional assumptions about WiFi and suggesting new architectures for digital networks that are based on physical proximity rather than solely connectivity. Most significantly, WiFi.Bedouin facilitates the creation of a truly mobile web community.
<p/>
       With the proliferation of &quot;WiFi Hot Spots&quot; and the mobile devices that access them, the public and private space surrounding us has become literally soaked through with Internet data. The promise of ubiquitous access to the Internet from anywhere, anytime is quickly being fulfilled.

<b>WiFi.Bedouin</b> is designed to be functional as well as provocative, expanding the possible meaning and metaphors about access, proximity, wireless and WiFi. This access point is not the web without wires. Instead, <i><b>it is its own web</b></i>, an apparatus that forces one to reconsider and question notions of virtuality, materiality, displacement, proximity and community. WiFi.Bedouin is meant to suggest that what are often considered two entirely separate realms - virtual and physical worlds - are actually a much more entangled hybrid space.
