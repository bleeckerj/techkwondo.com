WiFi.ArtCache is a project conceived and developed by Julian Bleecker. It was initially supported by Eyebeam Atelier during his R+D Residency, Summer and Fall of 2003.
<p/>
<b>Exhibition History</b><br/>
WiFi.ArtCache was exhibited at the Eyebeam Atelier <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/engage/exhibitions/betalaunch/beta_bleecker.html">&quot;Beta Launch&quot;</a> show
Oct 23 - Dec 13, 2003.

<b>Julian Bleecker</b><br/>
Julian Bleecker has long been involved in technology design, both the development work involved in building mobile and networked systems, and in his work to produce provocative human-machine entanglements. His work emphasizes expanding conventional understandings of technology, networks, public space, and mobility in order to engage broad social dialogues about technology and cultural change.
<p/>
Most recently he collaborated on PDPal, a psychogeography mapping project for the web and Palm PDA devices that allows maps to be created and shared based on experiential coordinates rather than the conventional coordinates of latitude/longitude and street addresses. It was recently installed in Times Square in New York City. 
<p/>
His work and writing has appeared in many venues including Wired, Afterimage, Whitney Museum of American Art's Artport, American Museum of the Moving Image, Bitforms Gallery, Walker Art Center, and more. His essay on SimCity 2000, &quot;Urban Crisis: Past Present and Virtual&quot; was recently translated into Italian for an <a href="http://www.ludologica.com/pages/11/index.htm">edited volume</a> commemorating the 15th Anniversary of that game.
<p/>
He is also a professional mobile and wireless technology consultant, and is on the faculty of the Design and Technology Department at Parsons School of Design and writes and lectures on technology and culture. He has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University, and an MS in Engineering (Computer-Human Interaction) from the University of Washington, Seattle.  He is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz's History of Consciousness Board of Studies. His dissertation is about the the ways in which technologies of visualization construct representations of reality and truth.
